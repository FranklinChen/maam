# JSAI: JavaScript Abstract Interpreter, modified to print number of errors. 

Please refer to the base version for all the details. This is a slightly modified version of JSAI that has a client analysis that reports the number of runtime errors that can be thrown. 

Run using the details provided in the base folder (everything else is the same). The only difference to run this version is to add `--stats` flag at the end of the command line while running the abstract interpreter, it prints out the number of errors (the error-precision client statistics in the paper are reported from this).
