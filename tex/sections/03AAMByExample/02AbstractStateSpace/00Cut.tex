In the AAM methodology, we first identify recursion in the state space and
replace it with indirection through addresses and a store.

%
Abstract time is introduced into the state space as a constantly increasing
value from which to allocate fresh addresses.

As a result of this change in the state space, the semantics will need to
change accordingly.
%
Variable lookup must fetch an address from the environment, and then fetch the
corresponding value bound to that address from the store.
%
Variable binding must allocate globally fresh addresses from the current time,
binding the formal parameter to the address in the environment and the address
to the value in the store.
